### Day 1: Wednesday, April 27, 2022

**Today's Progress :**
Started a new Calculator application with C#. Created a new folder called 100DaysOfCode and added a Git Watch to it.

**Thoughts :**
Seems pretty easy. Simple C# code. Made a class for the classic operations (add, subtract, multiplication, division). Most of the stuff we learnt from Programming during our classes in Programming 2 course. Would like to add more complicated functions though. And also convert it into a WinForms app later as well.
